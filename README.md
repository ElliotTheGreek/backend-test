# Reading List

## Task
Compose a site using a PHP MVC framework (Laravel, Symfony, SilverStripe, Dinkly; we are open to others, just run it by us before you start) that allows the user to create a list of books they would like to read. On the frontend, use the Bootstrap 4 library.

Users should be able to perform the following actions:

* Add or remove books from the list
* Change the order of the books in the list
* Sort the list of books by their author
* Display a book detail page with a minimum of author, publication date, and title

Please use an ORM rather than crafting queries by hand.

##### Bonus points!
* Deploy it for real so we can play with it! (and then tell us about how you deployed it)
* Handle image uploading while adding books to the list
* Do something fancy like integrating an external API or handling user authentication
* Make the frontend responsive
